This group project consists of three parts in order to create a movie recommender system:

- In the first part of this project we had to clean the dataset and understand the features. Then we had to create the basic predicates we will need in order to use Prolog. Then we had to create new predicates according to the projects requirements. 

- In the second part of this project we had to create the recommender function. Our project uses different Prolog functions each returning another degree of similarity and specific recommendations. Then our Python recommender system returns those answers and the degree of similarity.

- In the last part of this assignment we had to use vectors with rating weights and score weights. Specifically we had to use them with the train recommender function and predict example function in order to create a model which will then compute the effectiveness of our recommendations.
