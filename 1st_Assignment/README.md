This group project consists of four main parts:

- In the first part of this project we developed a program that is able to create random mazes on a given grid.

- In the second part of this project we had to implement a version of the A* algorithm using different combinations of heuristic cost and actual cost. As a result we created different algorithms for finding shortest paths based on the variations of A*. Afterwards we had to apply these algorithms on the mazes created in the first part.

- In the third part of this project we had to test the algorithms based on their complexity, finding the final destination, the length of the shortest path and the number of expanded nodes.

- Finally we had to create our own mazes in order to make it hard for the algorithms to reach the final goal and then test them.
