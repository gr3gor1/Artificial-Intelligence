This group project consists of four parts:

- The first part of this project had to do with implementing the accuracy function and understanding how the get_metrics, confusion_matrix and get_evaluation functions work. Then we had to analyze the dataset and split it in test dataset and train dataset while defining the label column of the data.

- In the second part of this project we had to implement the KNN classifier and then test its effectiveness using the code of the first part.

- In the third part of this project we had to create an implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and then check its effectiveness using the code of the first part.

- In the fourth and last part of this project we created an implementation of MLP classifier in comparison with an out-of-the-box MLP classifier.
